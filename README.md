# ðŸ–¼Art is Fun!

Art is Fun! is a C++ project that calculates the most valuable collection of paintings that will fit along a centered position on a wall. This is achieved by use of 3 different algorithms: brute force, most expensive first, and most efficient.

## Installation

This project can be run through the command line by moving into the folder containing the executable, and running the project.

This project requires 1 commend line argument: the path to the input file containing the data for the art and the wall.

```bash
$ cd ~/22s-pa01-chaeyoungcrew/cmake-build-debug
$ ./pa01 Resources/artTest.txt
```

## Usage

## Credits
This project was completed entirely by Zach Suzuki and Daniel Ryan for CS3353, Fundamentals of Algorithms taught by Dr. Fontenot.
